Gamling.org
=============================

This is the revival of Gamling.org.

I've figure out that I should plan it very well, as we will have several competitors time year.

The value of Gamling.org for users is to get real-time flood information on a certain location.

The value can be broken down into 3 principles:

* Recency
* Geographical coverage
* Accessibility

Or speaking in a more specific manner:

* Flood information that is older than 24 hours has no value to users
* Flood information that is NOT in an interested area of a user has no value to him/her
* If Gamling.org cannot be accessed from user's device, it has no value to users

Other peripheral principles:

* Easiness
* Privacy
* Feedback
* User-oriented

Or specifically speaking:

* Users don't need to authenticate themselves before submitting data; We identify them with unique ID generated from their phones.
* Users from website need to authenticate themselves.
* Users can see how many people view their posts, and their posts are expressed as special pins. They can see how much impact they have on other people.
* Users also have their impact score
* Trusted users are individual, who has integrity and won't abuse the system; We give them special pins
* Organizational users are restaurants, who want to announce that their branches are still open
* We don't show users' identities
* The levels of water are expressed in user's language: น้ำท่วมข้อเท้า (รถผ่านได้), น้ำท่วมครึ่งเข่า, น้ำท่วมเข่า (รถผ่านไม่ได้)
